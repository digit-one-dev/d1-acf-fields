# Release Notes for [v3.0.0]

## TL;DR

### Added

- BaseParentField to be extended by ACF fields that have sub_fields (enable recursive build and transform)
- ACF Layout field (usage of BaseSection is deprecated)
- Full support for builder pattern on BaseField for common configurations (label, instructions, default_value)

### Changed

- Add ACF registration parameters to BaseField constructor (passing those via the build method is deprecated)
- Namespace of this package
